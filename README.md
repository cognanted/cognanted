# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Matthew
I take an interest in the developement of video games along side the creation of tools linked to them.

## Current works
I am trying to learn Rust as of right now, I have purchased a book on the topic and am trying to find time to read it.<br>
Along side this in my free time I am building a game engine based on JS, I'm still not sure wether or not to make the repository public.
